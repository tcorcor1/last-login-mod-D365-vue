Aug 13, 2021

Microsoft has recently made some architectural changes moving the audit table to a NoSQL database. During this transformational period fetch XML aggregation has been disabled on the audit table which breaks this tool. This update is being gradually rolled out to all regions and may not effect you YET but will eventually.

I have been told by MS support that this is not permanent and fetch XML aggregation on the audit table will be restored. Schedule is (tentatively) end of September 2021.

I will be sure to update when I get more information.
